"""
QrySop is the root class of all query operators that use a
retrieval model to determine whether a query matches a document and to
calculate a score for the document.  This class has two main purposes.
First, it allows query operators to easily recognize any nested query
operator that returns a document scores (e.g., #AND (a #OR(b c)).
Second, it is a place to store data structures and methods that are
common to all query operators that calculate document scores.
