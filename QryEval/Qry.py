"""
The Qry class is the root class in the query operator hierarchy.
Most of this class is abstract, because different types of
query operators (Sop, Iop) have different subclasses, and each
query operator has its own subclass.  This class defines the
common interface to query operators, and is a place to store data
structures and methods that are common to all query operators.

Document-at-a-time (DAAT) processing is implemented as iteration
over (virtual or materialized) lists of document ids or document
locations.  To evaluate query q using the UnrankedBoolean retrieval
model:

  RetrievalModel r = new RetrievalModelUnrankedBoolean ();
  q.initialize (r);

  while (q.docIteratorHasMatch (r)) {
    int docid = q.docIteratorGetMatch ();
    double score = ((QrySop) q).getScore (model);
    System.out.println ("internal docid: " + docid + ", score: " score);
    q.docIteratorAdvancePast (docid);
  }

The Qry class defines the iteration interface and provides general
methods that each subclass may override or use.  Note that the 
iteration interface does not conform to the standard Python
iteration interface.  It has different characteristics and capabilities.
For example, getting the current element does not consume the
element; the iterator must be advanced explicitly, and it can be
advanced in different ways, which provides opportunities to evaluate
the query more efficiently.

The Qry class has two subclasses.  QrySop ("score operators") contains
query operators that compute document scores (e.g., AND, OR, SCORE).
QryIop ("inverted list operators") contains query operators that
produce inverted lists (e.g., SYN, NEAR, TERM).  

The docIterator for query operators in the QrySop hierarchy iterates
over a virtual list.  The next document id is determined dynamically
when hasMatch is called.  Thus, the iterator needs to be part of
the query operator, because different query operators may have
different strategies for determining what matches and how scores
are calculated.  When hasMatch identifies a match, the match is
cached so that it can be accessed efficiently by getMatch and
getScore methods.

The inverted lists of query operators in the QryIop hierarchy are
materialized when the query operator is initialized.  It is not
possible to produce them in a document-at-a-time mode because
the df and ctf statistics are not known until the inverted list
is fully constructed.  QryIop operators provide a document-at-a-time
interface to the inverted lists via docIterators.

The data structure that stores query arguments (args) is accessible
by subclasses.  If it is accessed via a standard Java iterator, the
search engine creates and then discards many (many) iterators during
query evaluation, which reduces computational efficiency.
